<h2>Banana Attack</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Player tries to collect as much bananas as possible without running into the fly. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the players to feel happy, relaxed and free of stress! 
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
This is a catching and slight dodging game. 
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Player use arrow keys to move platform left or right and obtain as much bananas as possible. There is bouncing fly that must be avoided. If the platform comes in contact with the fly, the game is over. Player can use the score keeper to keep track of how many bananas they have caught. Each banana caught is worth 10 points. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
The game prototype is to test collision of objects and score keeping. 
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Some unique aspects of my game are scoring, left and right arrows to move platform, and collision detection with fly. 
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game is set in a warm tropical forest. The platform represents a log that has monkeys trapped inside! The monkeys must push/manipulate the log to catch the falling bananas in order to gain enery and set themselves free! However, the monkeys can only move their log left or right, which makes it challenging to obtain bananas in higher places. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
Some very mean lumberjacks are cutting down trees in the tropical forest. Without noticing, they accidentally cut of a large banana tree which caused a great influctuations of falling bananas to the ground. The monkeys were so excited to see this storm of bananas falling from the sky that they accidentally got themselves stuck in a log. The only way for the monkeys to get out is to push the log around to catch the falling bananas, which will give them the sufficient energy to break out of the log. However, they also have to make sure to avoid the fruit fly thats also seeking for the bananas. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game targets children, and any adults who are looking for a stressfree game :) 
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
The game takes about half a minute or less
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Main player strategy is to be able to avoid the fly and use arrows to move left/right
